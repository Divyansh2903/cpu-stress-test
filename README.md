# CPU Stress Test Tool

A Python-based graphical tool to benchmark your system's CPU performance by running intensive computational tasks across all cores.

## Features

- Stress test all CPU cores using a customizable workload.
- Adjustable parameters for:
  - Task size (e.g., factorial size).
  - Test duration.
- Real-time progress updates with a graphical interface.
- Performance metrics:
  - Tasks completed per second.
  - Total tasks completed.
  - Total execution time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone "https://github.com/Divyansh2903/cpu-stress-test.git"
   cd cpu-stress-test
   python3 main.py
